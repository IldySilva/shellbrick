# Xell — Product Specification (MVP)

## 1. Vision

Xell is an open-source SSH workspace focused on:

- Minimalism
- Native platform experience
- Fast workflows
- Local-first architecture
- Beautiful terminal UX
- Deep integration with macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android

The goal is to become the most developer-friendly SSH workspace for engineers who care about speed, simplicity, and control — whether they are at their desk or on the move.

Xell should feel:
- fast
- calm
- powerful
- native
- trustworthy

---

# 2. Product Philosophy

## 2.1 Local First

Xell must work fully offline.

No account should be required for:
- SSH connections
- Host management
- Key management
- Terminal sessions

Cloud functionality is optional and future-facing.

---

## 2.2 Native Experience First

Xell must not feel like:
- Electron bloat
- a wrapped website
- a generic cross-platform UI

It should feel deeply integrated with each platform:
- macOS — respects system conventions, Keychain, and native window behavior
- Linux — respects desktop environment norms and Secret Service
- iOS — adapts to touch-first interaction, respects Human Interface Guidelines
- Android — adapts to Material conventions and Android lifecycle

---

## 2.3 Keyboard-Driven UX

The product should optimize for:
- speed
- shortcuts
- command palettes
- fast navigation
- power users

Mouse usage should be optional for advanced workflows.

---

## 2.4 Beautiful Minimalism

The UI should:
- avoid clutter
- prioritize whitespace
- emphasize typography
- reduce visual noise
- feel calm under pressure

Inspired by:
- Linear
- Raycast
- Ghostty
- Warp
- VSCode
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines
